# BUAA_OO_2022
- HiujinKuo's OO code of 2022.
## ‚ùó MUST_READ STATEMENT
- I am well aware of the feeling of being at a loss when facing OO assignments at the beginning of this semester, so I make my assignments'codes public for future students' reference. **All the codes have passed the enhanced tests**.
- These codes may not meet the requirements of the reader's current assignments.
- These codes are **only for reference and learning**, and provides inspiration for readers who are confused as well as helpless now. OO course has a **strict** duplicate checking system, so please don't copy these codes directly, otherwise you will bear the consequences.
